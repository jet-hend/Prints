# Prints
The prints, models, and programs i use

For converting chunks into a 3D model I use "Mineway"
it works on both Windows and Mac OS
you can find the download files at "https://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/downloads.html#downloadImgs"

For sliceing I use Crealitys slicer because i have a Ender 3 pro.
